        <p>Sharing insights from our journey to enhance user interaction through Ivie</p>

        <section id="introduction">
            <h2>Understanding User Needs</h2>
            <p>Throughout our design process, we've learned that user needs are as diverse as they are complex. Feedback
                from early testing showed that while some users praised the in-situ explanations, others were
                overwhelmed by the density of information.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="design-challenges">
            <h2>Challenges in Current Designs</h2>
            <p>"Too much at once can be as bad as too little" — this insight became clear when observing users interact
                with initial prototypes. Our challenge was balancing information density with accessibility.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="scenario">
            <h2>Scenario In General</h2>
            <p>Imagine Dorothy, a climate scientist who is about to perform exploratory data analysis of
                longitudinal climate data about the Amazon rainforest. Dorothy plans to use a common code-based data
                analysis toolset, namely, a contemporary code editor equipped with Copilot and a Python environment with
                the Pandas data manipulation library and Matplotlib visualization library pre-installed. In this
                scenario, Dorothy is using a code editor that has been extended with Ivie. Dorothy has passing knowledge
                of Pandas and Matplotlib—enough to do work with them—though she often consults online resources to find
                out how to fine-tune the API functions to manipulate and visualize data as she would like.</p>
            <p>For Dorothy, the explanations should fulfill her needs in:</blockquote>
            <blockquote>N1. She wants to know what parameters are necessary for her data processing.</blockquote>
            <blockquote>N2. She wishes the explanations could tell her what suitable values she should use for her data.
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>N3. She wants to ask some questions about the explanations and see some examples that also use
                the same
                code
                with suggestions.</blockquote>
            <blockquote>N4. She needs to validate the explanations since she does not fully trust the generated content.
            </blockquote>

        <section id="design-goals">
            <h2>Design Goals</h2>
            <p>We decided to only implement features of Parameter Insight and Parameter Compatibility Explorer to
                enhance direct interaction within the user's workflow. These tools provide immediate, contextually
                relevant information, crucial for quick decision-making. However, the challenge remains whether to
                integrate these insights directly into the main interface or utilize a separate interactive panel for
                detailed relationships, aiming to avoid overwhelming users with information.</p>

            <figure>
                <img src="figures/forbid.png" alt="Direct Parameter Interaction">
                <figcaption>Variant A: Direct Parameter Interaction - Shows parameter explanations by hovering, reducing
                    clutter.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <figure>
                <img src="figures/variant-b.png" alt="Separate Panel Display">
                <figcaption>Variant B: Separate Panel Display - Presents all parameters simultaneously, increasing
                    visibility but may overwhelm.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>As part of enhancing Ivie's usability, a key question arose: Should the interface display parameter
                relationships directly when a parameter is selected (Variant A), or should it present all parameter
                explanations simultaneously in a separate panel (Variant B)? This decision is crucial for balancing
                information accessibility with user interface complexity, directly impacting Dorothy's efficiency and
                comfort with the tool.</p>
            <p>Reflecting on this, it becomes essential to consider the effectiveness of each approach in real-world
                scenarios, guiding our final implementation based on user feedback and usability studies.</p>
        </section>


        <section id="user-study">
            <h2>Within-Subjects Study</h2>
            <p>To determine the most effective presentation of parameter relationships within Ivie, we compared two
                interface variants:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Variant A:</strong> Displays explanations by hovering over parameters, providing information
                    as needed and reducing screen clutter.</li>
                <li><strong>Variant B:</strong> Shows all explanations simultaneously in a separate panel, ensuring
                    comprehensive visibility but potentially increasing cognitive load.</li>
            </ul>
            <p> Eight participants were asked to interact with each variant, providing feedback through
                questionnaires on aspects such as usefulness, distraction, information overload, and understanding of
                the code. This feedback is crucial in informing whether the direct integration of features like
                Parameter Insight into the main interface is effective, or if a separate, dedicated panel should be
                considered to enhance user understanding without overwhelming them.</p>

            <p>The results indicate that Variant 1 generally provided more understandable and useful explanations
                compared to Variant 2, particularly in showing which parameters can and cannot be used together, where
                significant differences were found. The minimal distraction reported by users (median = 3.0) and not
                significantly different from Variant 2, suggests that the explanations in Variant 1, while effective, do
                not significantly increase cognitive load. This supports the design choice of providing integrated,
                interactive explanations in the user interface. However, some non-significant trends suggest room for
                further refinement in how information is presented to enhance clarity without overwhelming users.

        <section id="reflection">
            <h2>Reflective Insights</h2>
            <p>Throughout the development of Ivie, our user studies revealed crucial insights into the user's
                interaction with technology. For instance, while testing different interface variants, we found that
                users prefer direct, in-context explanations (Variant A) over floating panels (Variant B) as they reduce
                cognitive load and enhance comprehension, aligning with heuristic findings that emphasized visibility
                and directness.</p>

                understanding of the code structure and its functionality." — User Study Participant</blockquote>

        <section id="iterative-design">
            <h2>Iterative Design Learnings</h2>
            <p>Iterative design helped us identify that a dynamic interface, which adjusts based on user proficiency,
                significantly enhances user satisfaction. Seeing the interface adapt to user input proved crucial in
                providing support without overwhelming users with unnecessary information.</p>

        <section id="conclusions">
            <h2>Effective Interface Design</h2>
            <p>Our studies underscored the importance of adaptability in design. Direct, in-context explanations
                provided by Variant A were preferred for their effectiveness in enhancing understanding and reducing
                user frustration without overwhelming them with excessive information.</p>
